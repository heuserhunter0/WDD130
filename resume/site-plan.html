      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Who am I:
My name is Hunter Heuser. I am a student currently attending Brigham Young University – Idaho. My major is Computer Science, and I will hopefully graduate within a year. I am the middle child of three children in my family. My parents are fantastic, amazing, and wonderful people who have raised me to respect others, accept consequences of my own actions, and to treat others with kindness.
Work Experience: I have worked as Lifeguard when I was 16 for around 4 years, during which I gained more certifications to become a Swim Instructor, a Head Lifeguard, a Lifeguard Instructor, and a Pool Manager. I have also worked as Loader/Unloader and Belt Tender for UPS for around 2 years. I also drove for Amazon DSPs before attending school on campus. 
Coding: I have had an interest in programming since I was in Middle School. The idea that apps on our phones, video games, and services on our technology was intriguing. If you learned a programming language, you could do so many things that were awesome to me. The first class that I took was HTML in High School. We used Notepad to write our first lines of code. The next class was using Snap to create games, or fun art programs. Now that I am in college, I have learned Python, C, C++, C#, Erlang, HTML/CSS, and data structures, functions, algorithms, and Cybersecurity. It has been a journey that I want to continue to learn more and help our technology grow.

<br>Hobbies:</br>
I enjoy watching movies. I like Sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure. One of my favorite movies in the Sci-fi genre is Star Wars, The Revenge of the Sith. This film has a great lesson about great heroes who fall due to several factors, and yet there is a hope that things will get better eventually. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film for fantasy. Big secrets are revealed that change young Harry Potter’s life, and he learns how to conjure a spell that is capable of repelling a creature that represents depression. The last film that I will mention is The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the extended cut. This trilogy is the best adventure story ever told and remains one of the best adaptations of Tolkien’s works.
<br></br>
I love to spend time with my family. My family is a light in my world that provides comfort, love, learning, and security for me. My family has been with me through all types of trials in my life and has helped me through them. I could be anywhere with my family, and it would be a vacation. We do not need to go to big amusement parks, tourist destinations, or fancy restaurants to have happy memories. Some of my fondest memories happened at home, going to my siblings’ sports events, going hunting, and spending time with each other. 
<br></br>
I like to listen to music. From folk music to metalcore, I have a big taste in a variety of music genres. I grew up on country music, spent a lot of time listening to EDM, going to heavy metal band that sings about historical war topics. Whatever makes me think, has a great message, tells a story, or sounds good I will listen to. 
<br></br>
Playing games is my biggest pastime. I remember when my parents got me a GameCube. It was so fun and played many games with my siblings. I also fondly remember asking my parents if Santa could get us a Nintendo Wii for Christmas. They said that Santa would only get me that and that I would not get anything else for Christmas. I did not like that, so I saved up money. From birthday money, chores around the house, Easter, and other holidays I was able to save enough money with the help of my one of my siblings to buy it. That is one valuable lesson that my parents taught me, and I am grateful for it.
